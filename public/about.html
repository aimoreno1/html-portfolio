<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hey, I'm a 39-year-old dad of two, happily married to Dina. By day I'm grinding through life but after the kids are settled in, I'm diving headfirst into web development-currently powering through Dr. Angela Yu's Full-Stack Bootcamp and loving evevery deployed project.  When I need a break from Code, you'll find me unwinding with some video games.  Excited for this new chapter and can't wait to see where it takes me!
